<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Tina Stanitsa, a passionate web developer with a unique blend of experience in both academia and technology. For the past six years, I've been working as a Maths Lecturer, sharing my knowledge with students and nurturing their curiosity in the world of mathematics. With a solid academic background, including a Bachelor's in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in Computer Science, and a Master's in Banking and Finance, I bring a well-rounded perspective to everything I do, both professionally and personally.</p>

<p>As a web developer, I am driven by a constant desire to create and innovate. I enjoy the challenge of building intuitive, visually appealing websites that not only look great but also function seamlessly. My technical expertise is complemented by my teaching background, where I get the opportunity to break down complex concepts into digestible pieces, making it easier for my students to grasp. Whether it's coding a new project, tackling a complex mathematical problem, or finding the perfect balance between design and functionality, I love the process of problem-solving and continuous learning.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in coding or lecturing, I enjoy keeping a balanced lifestyle. I love to stay active by running and playing tennis, which helps me clear my mind and stay energized. A perfect day for me also includes spending time at the beach, feeling the sand beneath my feet and the ocean breeze on my face. In addition, I'm an avid cinema lover, always excited to explore new films and storytelling techniques. This diverse set of interests keeps me refreshed and fuels my creativity, both in my personal life and my work as a web developer.</p>
